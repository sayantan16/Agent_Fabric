- **LangGraph Engine**: Executes multi-agent workflows
- **Dual Registry**: Tracks reusable agents and tools

## Directory Structure
- `core/`: Core orchestration and factory components
- `generated/agents/`: Dynamically created agents
- `generated/tools/`: Dynamically created utility functions
- `agents.json`: Registry of available agents
- `tools.json`: Registry of available tools

## Status
POC in active development - implementing dynamic agent creation system.
